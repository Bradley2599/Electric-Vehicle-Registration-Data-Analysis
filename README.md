# Electric Vehicle Registration Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) registration data using Python and Power BI. The goal is to uncover key insights into EV adoption trends, top manufacturers, vehicle types, and popular locations.

## Data Source
U.S. Government's Data Portal (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-registration-data)

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (optional for data preprocessing)

- Python: Data processing and statistical analysis

- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data analysis and visualization

- Power BI : Used for create interactive dashboards and data visualization
